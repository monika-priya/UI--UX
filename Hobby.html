    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi there! I'm [Your Name], an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Design. I have a passion for combining technology and creativity to build innovative and user-friendly solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy exploring various aspects of computer science, from coding and algorithms to user interface design and graphic arts. This multidisciplinary approach allows me to bridge the gap between functionality and aesthetics, creating impactful and visually appealing digital experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my studies, I have gained proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, and HTML/CSS, and I'm continually expanding my knowledge and skills. I also have experience with design tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch, which enable me to bring my creative ideas to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that technology has the power to transform lives and shape the future. My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to meaningful projects that have a positive impact on society. I am enthusiastic about collaborating with others, learning from different perspectives, and embracing new challenges to continuously grow both as a computer scientist and a designer.

        Reading books has always been a significant part of my life. I have a particular fondness for scriptures and literature, as they offer a captivating blend of knowledge, storytelling, and introspection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scriptures hold a special place in my heart because they provide profound insights into spiritual and philosophical realms. Through these sacred texts, I gain wisdom, guidance, and a deeper understanding of life's purpose. Exploring the timeless teachings and principles found in scriptures brings me a sense of peace, solace, and spiritual growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Literature, on the other hand, takes me on captivating journeys through different worlds and eras. Whether it's classic novels, contemporary fiction, or poetry, literature exposes me to diverse perspectives, cultures, and human experiences. I am enthralled by the power of storytelling, the depth of characters, and the beauty of language used by great authors.
